## 💻 Notable Projects

### [Smart Public Safety Solution for Santander] | [PowerBI, Python, LangChain, scikit-learn, SODA API, ChromaDB, xgboost, prophet, sentence-transformers, Flask, ...]
We designed and implemented a reusable end-to-end data workflow from extraction and quality repair to parsing, feature engineering, and efficient dataset generation. The pipeline outputs structured Parquet files with metadata, ensuring reproducibility, transparency, and ease of scaling. Every step, model, and transformation remains tracked in-repo for auditability and extension. The project brings together time-series forecasting, spatial analytics, and machine learning into a single solution aimed at public safety intelligence. The dashboards make patterns and hotspots digestible, while the RAG component enables document-aware LLM querying. In short: data engineering + analytics + modeling + RAG, integrated into one coherent and scalable system for real-world decision-making.

### [Automated Defect Detection for IMUSA] | [Python, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, SICK AI Camera, ...]
Developed as part of the Special Academic Project at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, this initiative aimed to build an automated defect detection system for the metal sheets used in frying pan production at IMUSA. In collaboration with INTECOL S.A.S, and under the guidance of PhD. John W. Branch and Engineer Martín Aguilar Muñoz, we implemented a computer vision pipeline integrated with a SICK AI-powered industrial camera.
The project evolved from a quality control challenge into a real-world AI deployment roadmap, covering data acquisition, model training, and system integration for industrial inspection. Beyond achieving a functional defect detection prototype, it provided valuable insights into scalability, real-time inference, and automation in manufacturing environments.

### [Detecting Tuberculosis in X-Rays - Datacamp Challenge] | [Python, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision, Optuna, MLFlow, Scikit-Learn, CNNs, ...]
An applied deep learning project focused on detecting tuberculosis (TB) in chest X-ray images using CNNs and transfer learning (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet). The work includes comprehensive data analysis, image quality assessment, and clinical-oriented metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Designed as an AI-assisted screening tool, it demonstrates the potential of computer vision in medical diagnostics, emphasizing interpretability, model evaluation, and scalability for low-resource healthcare environments. Check it out here: [Datacamp Notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/25e1e2f8-42e9-4e9a-b963-c51c778e3e77)

### [Medical AI Dashboard - XGBoost Literature Classification] | [Python, Next.js, Flask, V0, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, ...]
A data-centric project developed for an AI Data Challenge, focused on automating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation for tabular datasets. The pipeline leverages Scikit-Learn and XGBoost to benchmark multiple models efficiently, visualize key metrics, and generate insights through a clean, interactive dashboard built with Next.js and Flask. Check it out here: [Github repo](https://github.com/Juanpa0128j/ai-data-challenge)


### [Multi-Agent Marketing Assistant] | [Python, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, Chainlit, ...]
A modular multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized AI agents for marketing analytics, content strategy, and project management. The system features dynamic agent routing, collaborative workflows through shared memory, and a clean API interface. Each agent (AnalyticsWiz, ContentGenius, ProjectManager) specializes in different marketing domains and can access relevant data sources. The architecture supports traceability, reproducibility, and extensibility through prompt versioning and a well-organized codebase. Check it out here: [Github repo](https://github.com/Juanpa0128j/multi_agent_workflow)

### [Lease Abstractor] | [Python, RAG, LangChain, AWS, ...] 
A data extraction tool that focuses on extracting explicit data from Commercial Real Estate Lease Agreements. In collaboration with [@marco](https://github.com/camachomarco) as a freelancer.
